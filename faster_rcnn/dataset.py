Original Faster-RCNN paper used PASCAL VOC 2007 and Microsoft COCO dataset.

Let's first try the smaller [PASCAL dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html):
* 20 classes, 9963 images, 24640 annotated objects.
* The data has been split into 50% for training/validation and 50% for testing. The distributions of images and objects by class are approximately equal across the training/validation and test sets.
